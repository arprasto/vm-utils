Download the linkx version of docker from the location Below
https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/ - search for the XE version you want download and download the linux version you want. I have downloaded 11.2.0.2
Download the following file for 11 G xe oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip
copy the file into the same folder as the docker file for 11g, you will fing the file after cloning the following git repository

-https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/

-copy the downloaded oracle zip file - oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip - in the same folder as dockerfile. the docker file may be called dockerfile.xe
and we may have to rename to the file to dockerfile and execute the following command

- docker build -t oracle/database:11.2.0.2-xe . (there is a . in the end indicating the folder that contains the dockerfile,  pwd, the current folder).


Once the image is built you can use the below command to start a container using the image.

-- to run Oracle
docker run --shm-size=1g -p 1521:1521 -p 8080:8080 -e ORACLE_PWD=password -v oradata01:/u01/app/oracle/oradata --detach --name oracle_XE oracle/database:11.2.0.2-xe


-- use this location to understand the different options set in the above command.

https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance

-- you can log in using sql plus using sys as below.

sqlplus sys/password@//localhost:1521/XE as sysdba

-- create a new user and grant him privileges.

create user curamibm identified by password;

 grant connect,dba to curamibm;

alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/XE/system.dbf' autoextend on maxsize unlimited;


then use sql developer or any other tool outside docker to connect to it.

-- host:localhost
   database --> service name  : XE
   port 1521 ( as bounded in the run oracle command.)


-- to execute and access inside the docker please use below command

 docker exec -it cranky_dhawan bash

 cranky_dhawan is the system assigned name for my container, bash the command its executing, the result is a bash shell will open as


 select tablespace_name,bytes from dba_data_files
 where  tablespace_name = 'SYSTEM';

 select file_name, file_id, status from dba_data_files
where  tablespace_name = 'SYSTEM';
